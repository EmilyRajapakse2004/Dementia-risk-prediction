# Dementia Risk Prediction System

## Project Overview

The **Dementia Risk Prediction System** is a machine learning–based application designed to predict whether a newly added patient has a **risk of dementia** based on clinical and demographic data.

This system supports early risk screening and is intended for **academic and research purposes only**.
